Tips on using the RSC Emulator:


-There is a default program loaded into the RSC at startup, and located in
 the archive is an example written in RSC assembly code. Use these Examples
 to get familiar with how to program the RSC.

-Once you have a program running, make sure you click on 'help'
 and read through the items in the menu.  The 'Debugging Code' menu item is
 very useful.
